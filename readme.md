# Acdmy

## Synchronous Online Learning Concept

Acdmy is a design concept for what a truly good synchronous online learning platform should look like if it were designed by educators, for educators. Although it is envisioned as a way for a group of people to meet online and communicate/collaborate in real time using video, audio, text, etc., Acdmy is imagined to be different.

It is not a web conferencing platform. It is an online learning environment conducive to student interaction in both formal and informal ways. It is based on concepts grounded in educational theory and the learning science to promote social and emotional presence, practical inquiry, motivation, and active learning. It is an ongoing project and an ever-changing one.
